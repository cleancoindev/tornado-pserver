    with data stream definied by:
       netstring (http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt)

    A server is defined by a request callback that takes an Request
    instance as an argument and writes data back with calling
    `Request.write`. After data is written,  `Request.finish` can be
    called with keep_alive option to overwrite default. `Request.finish`
    finishes the request (but does not necessarily close the connection
    in the case of keep-alive requests). A simple example server that
    echoes back the URI you requested::

        import pserver
        import ioloop

        def handle_request(request):
           request.write("OK")
           request.finish(keep_alive) = False)   # this is optional

        server = pserver.PServer(handle_request)
        server.listen(8888)
        ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()

    `PServer` is a very basic connection handler.
    It accept request which is single line bytes stream, and call on it
    `request_handler`. It also implementes keep-alive connections, which
    is True be default. You can provide the ``keep_alive`` argument to the
    `PServer` constructor, which will ensure the connection is not closed
    on every request. This can be overwrited by request_handler on request object

    `PServer` are the same as initialization methods defined on
    `tornado.netutil.TCPServer`:
